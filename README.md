# Shortest_path_planning_robot
# Description
This project involves developing a robot capable of finding the shortest path in a simulated environment using various algorithms such as Dijkstra, A-star, and the greedy algorithm. The project integrates multiple tools and platforms including Gazebo for simulation, RViz for visualization, and ROS for robot control. Users can select a target location in RViz, and the system will compute the optimal path and navigate a TurtleBot to the destination within the Gazebo environment.

# Requirements
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Gazebo
- RViz
- Python 3.x
# Features
- Simulates a TurtleBot navigating through an environment.
- Supports multiple path planning algorithms.
- Real-time visualization using RViz.
- Integration with Gazebo for realistic simulation.
# Algorithms
# Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
# A-star Algorithm
- An informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to improve efficiency by selecting paths that minimize both cost and estimated distance to the goal.
# Greedy Algorithm
- A heuristic-based approach that selects paths based on immediate cost without considering future steps.

These algorithms each have unique strengths and trade-offs, making them suitable for different aspects of robotic path planning in my project. Including visual outputs like pictures and videos can help demonstrate how these algorithms perform in real-world scenarios within our simulation environment.
